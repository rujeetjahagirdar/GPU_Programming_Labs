# CSE 4373/5373 Lab 4

Covers reductions in CUDA.

# Objective

Implement a kernel the performs reduction of a 1D list. The reduction should give the sum of the list. Your kernel should be able to handle input lists of arbitrary length. However, for simplicity, you can assume that the input list will be at most `2048 x 65535` elements so that it can be handled by only one kernel launch. The boundary condition can be handled by filling "identity value (0 for sum)" into the shared memory of the last block when the length is not a multiple of the thread block size. Further assume that the reduction sums of each section generated by individual blocks will be summed up by the CPU.

# Instructions

Edit the code in the code tab to perform the following:

- allocate device memory
- copy host memory to device
- initialize thread block and kernel grid dimensions
- invoke CUDA kernel
- copy results from device to host
- deallocate device memory
- implement the improved reduction routine
- use shared memory to reduce the number of global accesses, handle the boundary conditions in when loading input list elements into the shared memory
- implement a CPU loop to perform final reduction based on the sums of sections generated by the thread blocks

Instructions about where to place each part of the code is demarcated by the `//@@` comment lines.

# Build Instructions

The data and tests can be generated and run in the same way as in previous labs.
